Grit7z is a small plugin for the popular 7-Zip archiver. You can use Grit7z with
7-Zip to to open, modify, or create .pak archives, which are used in Chrome or 
Chromium-based browsers.

INSTALLATION

To install the plugin into the 7-Zip installation folder, you need to create the
"Formats" subfolder. After that, copy Grit.64.dll or Grit.32.dll (depending on
your 7-Zip edition) to that subfolder. If you do that, each time you launch
7-Zip, it will automatically find Grit7z and use it when opening .pak files.
